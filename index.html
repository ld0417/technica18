                            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is regarded as the first computer programmer. Lovelace was born 10 December 1815 as the only child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Byron.

At 19, she became Oxford’s youngest graduate from the Masters Program. She went to the Deutsche Bank after graduation, and since then has become a vocal advocate for the work of women in STEM. She established the Stemettes organization, and promotes panel sessions, hackathons and other programs that are designed to attract girls and young women to a career in science, math, engineering and technology.

                            Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and the one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches. Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".

                            Madam Curie is the only women in history to win two Nobel Prizes. She was awarded both in 1903 and 1911 for her contributions to science. Her work on radioactivity has been of paramount importance to humankind.  After her husband's tragic death, she gained her doctorate in 1903 and took his position as the Professor of General Physics in Sorbonne, Paris in 1906. She was the first woman to hold this position. She was also appointed as the director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914. Her obsession and thirst for discovery for the subject of radioactivity ultimately led to her untimely death. A sacrifice that has not been forgotten.

                            Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born on August 17, 1936)[2] is an American computer scientist, systems engineer, and business owner. She is credited with coining the term "software engineering". Hamilton was Director of the Software Engineering Division[3] of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo space program.[4] In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and software design.

In 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani was one of only four people to receive a Fields Medal, which is regarded as the most prestigious award in mathematics since there is no Nobel Prize for math. She’s also the first woman to ever receive the award. She studies shapes and surfaces in several fields of abstract mathematics including hyperbolic geometry. Mirzakhani tackles important questions in these fields — like “how many simple closed geodesics shorter than some given length can there be on a particular Riemann surface” — by taking novel approaches to the problems that other mathematicians have said is nothing short of “truly spectacular.”
